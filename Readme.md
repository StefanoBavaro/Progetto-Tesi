#LSTM models for Business Process Monitoring

Implementation of different versions of LSTM neural networks trained on event logs. 
The LSTM networks aims at predicting the remaining execution time, the outcome and the next activity of an ongoing trace.
The LSTM architecture changes depending on whether the features are predicted together or not, and depending on the encoding of a trace.
